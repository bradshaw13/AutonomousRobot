# AutonomousRobot
Personal/Internship Projects

The repository contains the code that I used for my AI / ML / Robotics Project 
during my internship at Jenkinson Enterprises. I am using a Raspberry Pi, GoPiGo3, 
and Grove Pi. The robot is autonomous and was done on my own with some help from 
the Houston Robotics Club. If you are from the Houston Robotics Club feel free to 
use my code as a reference to help you learn how to make your own projects while 
using the GoPiGo3 or Grove Pi. The code that starts out with "simple" is a way that 
I got familiar with a certain sensor or attachment on the Grove Pi or GoPiGo3. The 
"Version#" code is the autonomous code that moves the robot, with 0 being the first 
version and 2 being the latest version with the highest capabilities and attachments.
